# Code Review Reports

This directory contains comprehensive code review reports for the PR Rule Bot project. Each review captures findings, recommendations, and action items that are then formalized as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Review Process

### 1. Code Review
Reviews are conducted periodically or when significant changes are made. Each review:
- Analyzes architecture and design patterns
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Evaluates code quality and testing
- Assesses performance and configuration
- Provides actionable recommendations

### 2. Documentation
Review findings are documented with:
- Clear severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific file references and line numbers
- Code examples demonstrating issues and fixes
- Impact assessment for each finding

### 3. ADR Creation
Critical decisions and major changes from reviews are formalized as ADRs:
- Security implementations → Security ADRs
- Architecture changes → Design ADRs
- Infrastructure changes → Infrastructure ADRs

## Review Categories

### Security Reviews
Focus on:
- Authentication and authorization
- Secrets management
- API security
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

### Architecture Reviews
Focus on:
- Design patterns compliance
- Separation of concerns
- Dependency management
- Code organization

### Performance Reviews
Focus on:
- Reactive programming practices
- Resource management
- Blocking operations
- Scalability concerns

### Testing Reviews
Focus on:
- Test coverage
- Test quality
- BDD practices
- Integration testing

## Severity Levels

### Critical
**Impact:** Security vulnerability or data loss risk
**Timeline:** Fix immediately (within 24 hours)
**Examples:** No authentication, SQL injection, exposed secrets

### High
**Impact:** Significant functionality or reliability issue
**Timeline:** Fix within 1 week
**Examples:** Memory leaks, missing error handling, poor resilience

### Medium
**Impact:** Code quality or maintainability concern
**Timeline:** Fix within 1 month
**Examples:** Missing tests, configuration issues, technical debt

### Low
**Impact:** Minor improvement or enhancement
**Timeline:** Fix when convenient
**Examples:** Code style, documentation, optimizations

## Issue Tracking

Each finding includes:
- **Unique ID:** Format `<Category>-<Number>` (e.g., CI-1, I-2, S-3)
  - CI = Critical Issue
  - I = Improvement
  - S = Security
  - P = Performance
  - C = Configuration
- **Severity:** Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Component:** Affected module or layer
- **File References:** Specific locations with line numbers
- **Related ADR:** Link to formal decision record

## Review Schedule

### Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly:** Full codebase review
- **Monthly:** Security-focused review
- **Per Major Feature:** Architecture review

### Triggered Reviews
- Before production deployment
- After security incidents
- When adding new dependencies
- After major refactoring

## How to Use These Reports

### For Developers
1. Read the latest review before starting work
2. Check if your changes address open findings
3. Reference findings when creating PRs
4. Update ADRs when implementing fixes

### For Code Reviewers
1. Use findings as checklist items
2. Verify fixes address root causes
3. Ensure new code doesn't reintroduce issues
4. Update review status when issues are resolved

### For Project Planning
1. Track high-priority findings in sprint backlog
2. Allocate time for technical debt reduction
3. Schedule security improvements
4. Plan architecture evolution
