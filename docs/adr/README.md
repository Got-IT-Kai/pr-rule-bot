# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains architectural decisions made for the PR Rule Bot project, following the ADR pattern to document important technical choices.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help understand why certain technical choices were made and serve as a reference for future decisions.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were evaluated?

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- Description
- Pros/Cons
- Why rejected

## Implementation

How will this decision be implemented?

### Architecture & Design

**[ADR-0001: Non-Blocking I/O](./0001-non-blocking-io.md)** (Accepted)
- Use Spring WebFlux for reactive programming
- Full non-blocking architecture
- Status: Implemented

**[ADR-0002: Automate PR Reviews via GitHub Actions](./0002-automate-pr-reviews-via-github-actions.md)** (Accepted)
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Switch from self-hosted to managed AI API
- Status: Implemented

### Infrastructure & Security

**[ADR-0003: Webhook Security](./0003-webhook-security.md)** (Proposed)
- Implement GitHub webhook signature verification
- Add security layer to prevent unauthorized API access
- Related to: Code Review CI-1

**[ADR-0004: Bot Identity Management](./0004-bot-identity-management.md)** (Proposed)
- Fix duplicate review detection
- Properly identify bot-generated reviews
- Related to: Code Review CI-3

**[ADR-0005: Rate Limiting Strategy](./0005-rate-limiting.md)** (Proposed)
- Implement rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Prevent DDoS and resource exhaustion
- Includes Kafka migration considerations
- Related to: Code Review CI-2

### Observability & Operations

**[ADR-0006: Observability Strategy with OpenTelemetry](./0006-observability-strategy.md)** (Proposed)
- Environment-specific OTEL configuration
- Distributed tracing with Tempo/Jaeger
- Metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- CI pipeline trace analysis
- Production monitoring infrastructure

## ADR Lifecycle

### Status Definitions

- **Proposed:** Decision under consideration
- **Accepted:** Decision approved and ready for implementation
- **Implemented:** Decision fully implemented in codebase
- **Deprecated:** Decision no longer relevant but kept for historical context
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer ADR

### Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template above
2. Number sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Create PR for review
5. Update this index
6. Link to related code reviews or issues

### Updating Existing ADRs

- ADRs are immutable once accepted
- To change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Mark the old ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXX"

## Decision Categories

### Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Secrets management
- API security
- Rate limiting

### Performance
- Scalability decisions
- Resource optimization
- Caching strategies

### Architecture
- Design patterns
- Service boundaries
- Data models

### Integration
- External services
- API contracts
- Event schemas

## Relationship with Code Reviews

ADRs are often created as a result of code review findings:

1. **Code Review identifies issue** → Document in code review report
2. **Propose solution** → Create ADR with alternatives
3. **Review and approve** → Accept ADR
4. **Implement** → Reference ADR in implementation
5. **Update status** → Mark ADR as implemented

## Quick Reference

| ADR | Title | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|-----|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| 0001 | Non-Blocking I/O | Accepted | - | High |
| 0002 | Automate PR Reviews | Accepted | - | Medium |
| 0003 | Webhook Security | Proposed | Critical | Medium |
| 0004 | Bot Identity Management | Proposed | High | Low |
| 0005 | Rate Limiting Strategy | Proposed | High | Medium |
| 0006 | Observability Strategy | Proposed | Critical | High |

## Best Practices

1. **Be Concise:** Focus on the decision, not implementation details
2. **Provide Context:** Explain the problem being solved
3. **Consider Alternatives:** Document why other options were rejected
4. **Track Consequences:** Both positive and negative impacts
5. **Reference Evidence:** Link to benchmarks, research, or discussions
6. **Keep Updated:** Mark status changes as decisions evolve
